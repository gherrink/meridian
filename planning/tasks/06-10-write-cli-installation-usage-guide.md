# Task 6.10: Write CLI Installation and Usage Guide

> **Epic:** Integration, Docs & Polish
> **Type:** Docs
> **Priority:** Medium
> **Effort:** Small (< 1 day)
> **Dependencies:** 4.12
> **Status:** Pending

## Goal
Write a polished, user-facing CLI installation and usage guide that consolidates and expands on the initial documentation from task 4.12.

## Background
This is the definitive guide for installing and using the Meridian CLI. It should cover platform-specific installation, configuration, command reference, and real-world workflow examples.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Platform-specific installation instructions (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- [ ] First-run setup guide (`meridian config init`)
- [ ] Complete command reference with all flags and examples
- [ ] Real-world workflow examples (daily development, project review)
- [ ] Output format guide (table, JSON, plain)
- [ ] Troubleshooting section
- [ ] Integration tips (shell aliases, scripts)

## Subtasks
- [ ] Review and expand task 4.12 documentation
- [ ] Write platform-specific installation sections
- [ ] Write first-run configuration walkthrough
- [ ] Expand command reference with more examples
- [ ] Write real-world workflow examples
- [ ] Write shell integration tips (aliases, completions)
- [ ] Write troubleshooting section
- [ ] Add FAQ section

## Notes
- Build on the documentation from task 4.12 — don't start from scratch
- Shell completion setup is an important usability feature — document it prominently
- Workflow examples should feel like real scenarios: "Morning standup prep", "Triaging new issues", "Completing a sprint"
- Place in `docs/cli-guide.md` in the repo
